# Android Audio Recorder

While navigating google play for a simple audio recording app I found out most of the free ones to be riddled with ads so I thought I'd give it a try and learn about Android development in the process.

## Building

Clone the repository to local directory, run and build with Android Studio.

## Android Version Targeting

TnpAndroidRecorder targets Android API 28: Android 9.0 (Pie) and has minimum SDK version requirement of API 23: Android 6.0 (Marshmallow).
